# Investigating the Feasibility of Lightweight 1D CNNs for Corrosion Defect Detection

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of a lightweight 1D CNN model for corrosion defect detection. This project was presented at the 4th BİLSEL International EFES Scientific Research Congress in İzmir, Turkey. 

**Key Features:**

* **Lightweight 1D CNN:** Efficient model for resource-constrained devices.
* **Corrosion Defect Detection:** Accurate identification of corrosion damage in materials.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/hunter123520/Corrosion-Deffect-Detection]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. **Run the notebook:** Open **Corrosion Deffect Detection.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
